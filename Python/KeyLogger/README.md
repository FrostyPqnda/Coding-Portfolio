A crappily-built key logger designed to collect keyboard inputs from the user. The type of keyboard inputs that will be collected from the users will be instances of when they press an alpha chararacter (letter). The data collected will be used to measure the frequency of each alpha character pressed by the user.
 
NOTE: Upper and lowercase letters will be treated the same for simplicity sake. 

HOW TO USE:
- Run the program (must be able to run Python).
